Description: Cloud Foundry Go Router
 The Router routes traffic coming into Cloud Foundry to the appropriate
 component â€“ usually Cloud Controller or an application running on a DEA node.
 The router is implemented in Go. Routers listen for the messages that a DEA
 issues when an application comes online or goes offline, and maintain
 an in-memory routing table.
 Incoming requests are load balanced across a pool of Routers.
